# GameBots
 
 
Almost all of you are familiar with the dinosaur game which is used play in google chrome in both offline or online.
So I have tried to develop a gamebot named 'dinosaurBot' which can play automatically.
Though still I am working with it for nearly 100% accuracy so that it can be score with more than 7 digit.

## Here is demo video for this project. Hope to complete very soon and the full video will be uploaded.

I have scored 823 with my another gameBot, named 'pianoTilesBot'. It will show more efficiency with the High RAM PC.
Although I am still working with it to achieve more accuracy.

## Here is demo video for this project. And hope you will enjoy it.
